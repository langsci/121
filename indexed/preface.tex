The 28 papers in this volume were presented at the 46th Annual Conference on African Linguistics, held at the University of Oregon, March 26-28, 2015. The conference featured nearly 120 papers (themselves vetted by abstract submission), covering work on phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax, semantics, discourse, sociolinguistics, and historical linguistics, as well as a workshop on Luhyia languages of East Africa. The selected papers in this volume represent the broad range of topics, language families, and careful analyses that characterized the conference, as well as the maturation of research in African linguistics. 

The volume editors would like to thank several units whose generous support has made this volume possible: the Association of Contemporary African Linguistics (ACAL); 
and the University of Oregon Linguistics Department, 
 GLOSS (University of Oregon Graduate Linguistics Students organization), 
 African Studies Program, 
 College of Arts and Sciences, 
 Division of Equity and Inclusion, 
 Ford Alumni Center, 
 Global Oregon, 
 Office of International Affairs,
 American \ili{English} Institute, 
 and Yamada Language Center.
