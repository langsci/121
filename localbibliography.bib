@article{cole:2008,
	Abstract = {A widely held position in the literature on verbal meaning is that the lexical-semantic representation of verbs involves complex event structures with semantic primitives like CAUSE and BECOME (e.g. Dowty 1979). A growing number of recent works on predicate decomposition have shown that there is a close correlation between the semantics of event structure and the syntax (e.g. Hale \& Keyser 1993, Harley 1995, Travis 2000, van Hout 2000, Ramchand 2003, 2007). This article presents an additional empirical argument for the view that there is a direct mapping between semantic decomposition of predicates and the (morpho)syntax by developing an explicit analysis of the semantics and syntax of the verbal suffix -kan in Standard Indonesian. We argue that -kan is a morphological reflex of the RESULT head, the semantics of which gives rise to a causative interpretation. By treating -kan as being sensitive to a syntactic configuration involving a result state, the current analysis not only provides important empirical support for the event decomposition of predicates in the syntax but also leads to a unified semantic and syntactic account of -kan, which captures straightforwardly distributional properties of the suffix.*.},
